localmemcache README
=====================

Efficiently sharing a hashtable between processes on a local Unix machine.

WHAT IS IT?
===========

localmemcache aims to be faster than using memcached locally by using shared
memory, but providing a similar interface.

WHY?
====

If you use memcache locally (eg. for communication between processes that are
written in different programming languages), it's very inefficient.

HOW?
====
localmemcache is essentially three components:

- a wrapper around mmap()
- an allocator that works with relative memory addresses (replaces malloc(), etc.)
- hashtable data type

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

- Unix (for mmap)
- A CPU architecture with more than 32 bit is recommended, since otherwise you
  might run out of virtual address space when you use larger shared memory
  segments.
