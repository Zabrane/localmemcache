Localmemcache README
=====================

The beauty of memcached.  For local data.  Blazingly fast.

WHAT IS IT?
===========

Localmemcache is a library for C and ruby that aims to provide an interface
similar to memcached but for accessing local data instead of remote data.  It's
based on mmap()'ed shared memory for maximum speed.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

- Unix (for mmap)
- A CPU architecture with more than 32 bits is recommended, since otherwise you
  might run out of virtual address space when you use larger shared memory
  segments.

EXAMPLE
=======

In Ruby:

require 'localmemcache'
$lm = LocalMemCache.new :namespace => "viewcounters"
$lm[:foo] = 1
$lm[:foo]
$lm.delete(:foo)

INSTALLATION
============

Ruby binding:

# gem install localmemcache
