localmemcache README
=====================

Efficiently sharing a hashtable between processes on a local Unix machine.

WHAT IS IT?
===========

localmemcache aims to be faster than using memcached locally by using shared
memory, but providing a similar interface.


PERFORMANCE
===========
Here's a quick speed comparison

Benchmark code:

2_000_000.times {
  index = rand(10000).to_s
  $hash.set(index, index)
  $hash.get(index)
}

MemCache:      253326.122 ms
LocalMemCache: 7220.071 ms
Ruby's Hash:   4963.313 ms

localmemcache is about 30-40 faster than using memcache locally, and about
twice as slow as using Ruby's hash.

EXAMPLE
=======

In Ruby:

require 'localmemcache'
$lm = LocalMemCache.new :namespace => :viewcounters, :size_mb => 200
$lm[:foo] = 1


INSTALLATION
============

Ruby interface:

$ gem install localmemcache

C:

$ cd src
$ ./configure && make install


How localmemcache works
=======================

localmemcache is essentially three components:

- a wrapper around mmap()
- an allocator that works with relative memory addresses (replaces malloc(), etc.)
- hashtable data type

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

- Unix (for mmap)
- A CPU architecture with more than 32 bit is recommended, since otherwise you
  might run out of virtual address space when you use larger shared memory
  segments.
