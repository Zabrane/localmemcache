Localmemcache README
=====================

A persistent key-value database based on mmap()'ed shared memory.

* http://localmemcache.rubyforge.org/

WHAT IS IT?
===========

Localmemcache is a library for C and ruby that aims to provide
an interface similar to memcached but for accessing local data instead of
remote data.  It's based on mmap()'ed shared memory for maximum speed.
Since version 0.3.0 it supports persistence, also making it a fast
alternative to GDBM and Berkeley DB.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

- a >=64bit Unix
- a file system that offers sparse files

Note for OS X: OS X disqualifies as HFS+ doesn't have sparse files and
sem_timedwait() and sem_getvalue() aren't supported as well.

Note for FreeBSD: It has been reported that Localmemcache sometimes hangs
there, it is not yet clear what the problem is.

EXAMPLE
=======

In Ruby:

require 'localmemcache'
# 1. the memcached way
# $lm = LocalMemCache.new :namespace => :viewcounters
# 2. the GDBM way
$lm = LocalMemCache.new :filename => "./viewcounters.lmc"
$lm[:foo] = 1
$lm[:foo]
$lm.delete(:foo)

INSTALLATION
============

Ruby binding:

# gem install localmemcache
