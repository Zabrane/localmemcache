<h1>Efficiently sharing a hashtable between processes on a local Unix machine.</h1>

<p><b>Localmemcache</b> aims to be faster than using <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a> locally by using shared memory and providing a similar interface for Ruby and C.

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The Ruby binding is available as a Ruby Gem. It can be install by executing</p>

<pre><code>gem install localmemcache
</code></pre>

<h2>Using</h2>

<p>
<pre>
<code>
require 'localmemcache'
$lm = LocalMemCache.new :namespace => :viewcounters
$lm[:foo] = 1
$lm[:foo]
$lm.delete(:foo)
</code>
</pre>


</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Here's a quick speed comparison, made on an 
<b>Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5205 @ 1.86GHz</b></p>:

Benchmark pseudo code:

<pre><code>
2_000_000.times {
  index = rand(10000).to_s
  $hash.set(index, index)
  $hash.get(index)
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
MemCache:      <b>253,326.122</b> ms
LocalMemCache: <b>6,055.552</b> ms
Ruby's Hash:   <b>4,963.313</b> ms
</pre>

<b>Localmemcache</b> is about <b>40</b> times faster than using memcached
locally, and about 20% slower than Ruby's hash.
