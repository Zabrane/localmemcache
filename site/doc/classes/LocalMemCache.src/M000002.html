 * call-seq: LocalMemCache.drop(*args)
 *
 * Deletes a memory pool.  If the :force option is set, locked semaphores are
 * removed as well.
 *
 * WARNING: Do only call this method with the :force option if you are sure
 * that you really want to remove this memory pool and no more processes are
 * still using it.
 *
 * If you delete a pool and other processes still have handles open on it, the
 * status of these handles becomes undefined.  There's no way for a process to
 * know when a handle is not valid anymore, so only delete a memory pool if
 * you are sure that all handles are closed.
 *
 * valid options for drop are 
 * [:namespace] 
 * [:filename] 
 * [:force] 
 *
 * The memory pool must be specified by either setting the :filename or
 * :namespace option.  The default for :force is false.
